# Complete Payment Flow Test Guide

## ‚úÖ Backend Smart Contract Integration Fixed

### **üîß What Was Fixed:**

1. **IDL Integration**:
   - ‚úÖ Copied `voidmail_nft.json` IDL to backend
   - ‚úÖ Backend now properly loads and uses the IDL
   - ‚úÖ Smart contract verification uses correct instruction discriminators

2. **Enhanced Transaction Verification**:
   - ‚úÖ Detailed logging for every verification step
   - ‚úÖ Dual verification: transaction logs + instruction data
   - ‚úÖ Proper vault PDA calculation
   - ‚úÖ Amount and credits validation

3. **Backend Connection Test**:
   - ‚úÖ IDL loading verification
   - ‚úÖ Solana RPC connection test
   - ‚úÖ Program ID validation
   - ‚úÖ All tests passing

## üß™ Testing the Complete Flow

### **Step 1: Backend Verification**
```bash
# Test backend smart contract connection
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/credit/test-connection

# Test credit pricing
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/credit/pricing
```

### **Step 2: Frontend Wallet Connection**
1. **Connect wallet** using WalletConnect component
2. **Check console logs** for connection synchronization
3. **Verify both states** are connected:
   - Adapter: ‚úÖ
   - Store: ‚úÖ

### **Step 3: Payment Flow Test**
1. **Go to `/premium` page**
2. **Click "Pay Now"** on any credit package
3. **Confirm payment** in modal
4. **Check backend logs** for verification process
5. **Verify transaction** on Solana Explorer

## üîç Expected Backend Logs

When a payment is processed, you should see:

```
=== CREDIT PURCHASE VERIFICATION ===
Verifying transaction: [tx_hash]
Expected credits: 1

=== VERIFYING TRANSACTION ===
Transaction hash: [tx_hash]
Expected credits: 1
Transaction confirmed successfully
Program logs: [...]
Transaction involves our program
Vault PDA: [vault_address]
Vault account found at index: [index]
User account: [user_address]
Balance changes: { userAmountSent: 25000000, vaultAmountReceived: 25000000, fee: [fee] }
Expected amount for credits: 25000000
Credits from logs: 1
=== TRANSACTION VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL ===

=== VERIFYING SMART CONTRACT INSTRUCTION ===
Transaction hash: [tx_hash]
Expected credits: 1
Transaction found, checking instructions...
Number of instructions: [count]
Instruction 0: { programKey: [program_id], ourProgram: [program_id], matches: true }
Found our program instruction!
Instruction data length: 9
Discriminator: [hex]
Expected discriminator for purchaseCredits: [hex]
This is a purchaseCredits instruction!
Credits from instruction data: 1
Credits match!
=== INSTRUCTION VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL ===

All verifications passed, creating credit purchase record...
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the wallet connection** - Make sure both adapter and store are connected
2. **Try a payment** - Click "Pay Now" and check the console logs
3. **Verify backend logs** - Check the detailed verification process
4. **Check transaction** - Verify on Solana Explorer

## üêõ Debugging Tips

- **Check console logs** for detailed connection and verification info
- **Use the "üîÑ Sync Store" button** if wallet adapter is connected but store is not
- **Check backend logs** for transaction verification details
- **Verify program ID** matches your deployed contract

The backend is now properly integrated with your deployed smart contract! üéâ
